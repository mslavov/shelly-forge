# Update Logger to User Home Directory (2025-04-06 13:52:56)

_**User**_

can you update the logger to log to the user home dir instead of the process.cwd?

I'll update the logger to use the user's home directory instead of the current working directory.

---

```diff
  import * as fs from 'fs';
  import * as path from 'path';
+ import * as os from 'os';
  
  // Ensure logs directory exists
- const logsDir = path.join(process.cwd(), '.shelly-forge', 'logs');
+ const logsDir = path.join(os.homedir(), '.shelly-forge', 'logs');
  if (!fs.existsSync(logsDir)) {
      fs.mkdirSync(logsDir, { recursive: true });
```

---

The logger now stores logs in the user's home directory (~/.shelly-forge/logs) instead of the current working directory. This makes the logs consistent regardless of where the application is run from.
