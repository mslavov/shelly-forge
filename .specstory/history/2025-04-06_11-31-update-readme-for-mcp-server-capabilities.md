# Update README for MCP Server Capabilities (2025-04-06 14:31:42)

_**User**_

can you update the readme to reflect the new mcp server capabilities, refer to the @getting-started.md guide 

---

_**Assistant**_



---

I'll update the README.md to include information about the MCP server capabilities.

---

```diff
  -   Real-time device logs and debugging
  -   Project templates and examples
+ -   AI-assisted workflow with MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for device discovery and setup
+ 
+ ## AI-Assisted Development
+ 
+ Shelly Forge includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables seamless AI-assisted development:
+ 
+ - **AI-Powered Device Discovery**: Automatically scan your local network to find Shelly devices
+ - **Simplified Setup**: No need to manually look up device IPs or hostnames
+ - **Automated Configuration**: Generate solution configurations based on high-level instructions
+ - **Focus on Logic**: Concentrate on functionality rather than boilerplate code
+ 
+ For detailed instructions on using the AI-assisted workflow, see the [Getting Started with AI Guide](docs/getting-started.md).
  
  ## Quick Start
  Shelly.call('Switch.Set', { id: 0, on: true });
  ```
- 
- ## TODO
- 
- -   [ ] Add support for unit tests
- -   [ ] Add Shelly device emulators
- -   [ ] Improve the logs function to show only the logs and not the whole event object

- 
```

---

Now I'll also update the Quick Start section to mention the AI-assisted workflow option:

---

```diff
  
  ## Quick Start
+ 
+ ### Manual Setup
  
  1. Create a new project:
  npm run dev
  ```
+ 
+ ### AI-Assisted Setup
+ 
+ Alternatively, if you're using an AI-powered editor like Cursor:
+ 
+ 1. Initialize your project as above.
+ 
+ 2. Simply describe your goal to the AI:
+    ```
+    "Create a solution that turns on my Shelly Plug S every day at sunset."
+    ```
+ 
+ 3. The AI will discover devices on your network, generate code, and update configurations automatically.
+ 
+ 4. Start development as usual:
+    ```bash
+    npm run dev
+    ```
+ 
+ For more details, see the [AI-Assisted Workflow Guide](docs/getting-started.md).
  
  ## Concepts
```

---

Let me also update the TODO section to reflect the MCP server implementation, as it appears to be already implemented:

---

```diff
  Shelly.call("Switch.Set", { id: 0, on: true });
  ```
+ 
+ ## TODO
+ 
+ -   [ ] Add support for unit tests
+ -   [ ] Improve the logs function to show only the logs and not the whole event object
+ 
+ ## Contributing
  
```

---

The README.md has been successfully updated to reflect the new MCP server capabilities by:

1. Adding MCP server capabilities to the Overview section
2. Creating a new "AI-Assisted Development" section with details about the features
3. Updating the Quick Start section to include both manual and AI-assisted workflow options
4. Updating the TODO section to reflect the implemented MCP server feature

The updates reference the getting-started.md guide as requested.
