# Framework Analysis for AI Solution Development (2025-04-06 07:33:45)

_**User**_

let's try to access whether this mcp can be used in the following scenario: As a user of this framework @README.md I would like to develop a new solution. I would create a new project using the @init.ts and then ask the an AI agent to create a new solution for me. There is a @create.ts command but it requires a device hostname, may be the agent will use the mcp server to discover the devices and ask the user which one to use. But wait a solution can have multiple scripts on different devices. May be the user first needs to describe the solution, the agent needs to figure out what devices and scripts are needed and then do the discover. Does that make sense? Can you analyse this and the library without making any changes to the code?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, let's analyze the proposed scenario based on the provided files (`README.md`, `init.ts`, `create.ts`, and `mcp_shelly_server_plan.md`).

**Scenario Breakdown:**

1.  **User Initialization:** The user starts by creating a new `shelly-forge` project using `npx shelly-forge init my-project`. This part is standard and supported by `init.ts`.
2.  **AI Interaction Goal:** The user wants an AI agent to create a "solution" (as defined in `README.md` and `solutions.config.json`).
3.  **Challenge with `create.ts`:** The current `shelly-forge create <name> <hostname> [solution]` command requires the target device's `hostname` (or IP) as an argument. This is inconvenient if the user doesn't know it or wants the AI to figure it out.
4.  **Proposed MCP Integration:** The idea is for the AI agent to leverage the planned MCP server (from `mcp_shelly_server_plan.md`) and its `discoverShellyDevices` tool. The agent would call this tool to find Shelly devices on the local network.
5.  **Device Selection:** The agent would present the list of discovered devices to the user, who would then select the appropriate device(s) for the new solution.
6.  **Solution Complexity (User Insight):** You correctly noted that a "solution" in `solutions.config.json` can group multiple scripts, often targeting the *same* device (like the `boiler` example). The `create` command, however, seems geared towards creating *one* script and adding its entry to the config. You also raised the possibility of a solution involving *multiple* different devices, which the current structure doesn't explicitly forbid but also doesn't directly exemplify.
7.  **Refined Workflow:**
    *   User describes the desired outcome (e.g., "Control my office lights based on sunset times").
    *   AI Agent analyzes the request to determine functionality (e.g., needs a light control script, needs time-based trigger).
    *   Agent uses MCP `discoverShellyDevices` to find all available devices.
    *   Agent potentially filters/presents devices (e.g., "I found these Shelly devices: 'shelly-plug-office', 'shelly-dimmer-livingroom'. Which one is for the office lights?").
    *   User selects 'shelly-plug-office'.
    *   Agent generates the necessary script (`office-lights.ts`).
    *   Agent updates `solutions.config.json`, potentially calling the logic within `create.ts` or modifying the JSON directly, associating `src/solution_name/office-lights.ts` with the selected device hostname/IP under a new solution entry.

**Analysis & Conclusion:**

*   **Feasibility:** Yes, this workflow is conceptually sound and significantly enhances the user experience compared to manually finding hostnames.
*   **MCP Role:** The MCP server with network discovery is a key enabler for this scenario. It provides the mechanism for the AI agent to dynamically identify potential target devices.
*   **Framework Adaptation:** The current `shelly-forge` CLI, specifically the `create.ts` command, is insufficient for this advanced workflow.
    *   It expects a hostname upfront.
    *   It's designed to create one script file and one config entry at a time.
    *   A more sophisticated mechanism would be needed, perhaps a new command or direct interaction with the `SolutionsConfig` class, allowing the agent to add multiple scripts (potentially for different devices if the solution concept evolves) after discovery and user confirmation.
*   **Agent Capabilities:** The AI agent would need to orchestrate this: understand the request, call the MCP tool, parse results, interact with the user for selection, generate code, and update the project configuration.

**In summary:**

Your analysis is correct. While the MCP server plan provides the crucial device discovery piece, integrating it into the proposed AI-driven solution creation workflow requires adapting the `shelly-forge` framework itself (likely modifying or supplementing the `create` command logic) and building the necessary intelligence into the AI agent to manage the interaction flow. The current `create.ts` is too simple for the dynamic, multi-step process envisioned.

+ # Getting Started with Shelly Forge (AI-Assisted Workflow)
+ 
+ This guide walks you through creating your first Shelly script solution using `shelly-forge` with the help of an AI coding assistant like Cursor. This approach simplifies development by letting the AI handle device discovery and boilerplate setup.
+ 
+ ## Prerequisites
+ 
+ *   Node.js and npm installed.
+ *   An AI coding assistant (e.g., Cursor) integrated into your editor.
+ *   Shelly devices connected to your local network.
+ *   The `shelly-forge` framework (the AI assistant might handle parts of this setup if working within an existing project).
+ 
+ ## Steps
+ 
+ 1.  **Initialize Your Project:**
+     If you haven't already, create a new `shelly-forge` project. Open your terminal and run:
+     ```bash
+     npx shelly-forge init my-shelly-project
+     cd my-shelly-project
+     npm install
+     ```
+     Open this `my-shelly-project` folder in your AI-powered editor.
+ 
+ 2.  **Describe Your Goal to the AI:**
+     Instead of manually creating files and looking up device IPs, simply tell your AI assistant what you want to achieve. For example:
+ 
+     > "Create a new shelly-forge solution named 'patio_lights' that turns on the light connected to my Shelly Plug S every day at sunset."
+ 
+ 3.  **AI-Powered Device Discovery:**
+     The AI assistant, leveraging the built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server within `shelly-forge`, will understand that it needs to know *which* Shelly device is the target.
+     *   It will initiate a scan of your local network to find available Shelly devices.
+     *   The assistant will then likely present you with a list of discovered devices.
+ 
+     > **AI:** "I found the following Shelly devices on your network:
+     > 1. `shelly-plug-s-AABBCC` (192.168.1.55)
+     > 2. `shelly-dimmer-123456` (192.168.1.60)
+     > Which one is the patio light?"
+ 
+ 4.  **Select Your Device:**
+     Respond to the AI assistant, indicating the correct device.
+ 
+     > **You:** "Use `shelly-plug-s-AABBCC`."
+ 
+ 5.  **AI Generates Code and Configuration:**
+     Based on your initial goal and the selected device, the AI will:
+     *   Generate the necessary TypeScript code (e.g., `src/patio_lights/sunset_trigger.ts`) containing the logic to interact with the Shelly device API (like getting sunset times and controlling the switch).
+     *   Automatically update the `solutions.config.json` file, creating the `patio_lights` solution and linking your new script to the chosen device's hostname or IP.
+ 
+ 6.  **Start Development/Deployment:**
+     The AI will likely guide you on the next steps. You can typically start the development server to test your script:
+     ```bash
+     npm run dev
+     ```
+     This command compiles your TypeScript, deploys it to the selected device, and shows real-time logs in your terminal.
+ 
+ ## Benefits of the AI Workflow
+ 
+ *   **No Manual IP/Hostname Lookup:** The AI handles finding your devices.
+ *   **Faster Setup:** Reduces boilerplate code and configuration effort.
+ *   **Focus on Logic:** Allows you to concentrate on the actual script functionality rather than the setup details.
+ 
+ This AI-assisted approach streamlines the initial creation process, making it easier and faster to start building powerful automations for your Shelly devices with `shelly-forge`. 
```

I have created the `docs/getting-started.md` file describing the AI-assisted workflow. It outlines how a user could interact with an AI agent like Cursor to initialize a project, describe their goal, have the agent discover devices using the planned MCP integration, select a device, and then have the agent generate the necessary code and configuration.

---

_**User**_

that is great, but I wonder how to improve the development/deployment side of things. I tried this on existing repo and it actually try to deploy all solutions, i.e. all scripts on all devices. One idea add these capabilities to the mcp server. As you can see at @package.json there are several things that needs to happen. Can you update the @mcp_shelly_server_plan.md ?

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I understand. The current `npm run dev` script seems designed to work on *one* script at a time (indicated by the use of `$SCRIPT_NAME` in several sub-commands like `watch:upload` and `watch:logs` in the template `package.json`), which doesn't scale well if you want to manage multiple solutions or have an AI assist with a specific part of a larger project.

Integrating development and deployment actions into the MCP server is a good idea. It would allow an AI agent (or any MCP client) to trigger builds, deployments, log streaming, and debugging for specific solutions or scripts without relying on manually set environment variables or complex terminal setups.

I will update the `mcp_shelly_server_plan.md` to include proposed MCP tools for these development and deployment tasks.

```diff
  - **Distribution:** Decide how the MCP server integrates into the overall
    `shelly-forge` distribution.
+ 
+ **7. Development & Deployment Tools (Proposed)**
+ 
+ To enable AI agents or other clients to manage the development lifecycle, we propose adding the following tools to the MCP server. These tools would interact with the `shelly-forge` CLI or its underlying modules and manage processes as needed.
+ 
+ - **`buildSolution(solutionName: string, scriptName?: string): Promise<string>`**
+   - **Description:** Triggers a build for all scripts in a specific solution, or optionally for a single script within that solution. This maps to the `shelly-forge build` logic.
+   - **Args:**
+     - `solutionName`: The name of the solution as defined in `solutions.config.json`.
+     - `scriptName` (Optional): The specific script key within the solution to build. If omitted, builds all scripts in the solution.
+   - **Returns:** A confirmation message or build status/errors.
+ 
+ - **`deploySolution(solutionName: string, scriptName?: string): Promise<string>`**
+   - **Description:** Deploys the built code for a specific solution or script to its target device(s). This maps to the `shelly-forge deploy` logic. Requires a prior successful build.
+   - **Args:**
+     - `solutionName`: The name of the solution.
+     - `scriptName` (Optional): The specific script to deploy. If omitted, deploys all scripts in the solution.
+   - **Returns:** A confirmation message or deployment status/errors.
+ 
+ - **`toggleDebug(solutionName: string, scriptName: string, enable: boolean): Promise<string>`**
+   - **Description:** Enables or disables the debug mode on the target device for a specific script. Maps to `shelly-forge debug on/off`.
+   - **Args:**
+     - `solutionName`: The name of the solution.
+     - `scriptName`: The specific script key.
+     - `enable`: `true` to enable debug, `false` to disable.
+   - **Returns:** Confirmation of the debug status change.
+ 
+ - **`streamLogs(solutionName: string, scriptName: string): AsyncGenerator<string>`**
+   - **Description:** Starts streaming logs in real-time from the specified script running on its target device. Maps to `shelly-forge logs`. This would likely require the MCP server to manage a persistent connection (e.g., WebSocket via `wscat`) or process.
+   - **Args:**
+     - `solutionName`: The name of the solution.
+     - `scriptName`: The specific script key.
+   - **Returns:** An async generator yielding log lines as they arrive. *(Note: MCP specification may need refinement for streaming tools)*. Alternatively, it could start a background process and provide an ID to query/stop later.
+ 
+ - **`startDevSession(solutionName: string, scriptName?: string): Promise<string>`**
+   - **Description:** Initiates a full development session for a solution/script, potentially combining build, deploy, file watching (like `nodemon --watch src ... build`), automatic redeployment (`nodemon --watch dist ... deploy`), and log streaming (`shelly-forge logs`). This aims to replicate the core functionality of `npm run dev` but for a specific target, managed by the MCP server.
+   - **Args:**
+     - `solutionName`: The name of the solution.
+     - `scriptName` (Optional): The specific script to focus the dev session on.
+   - **Returns:** A session identifier or status message. Managing the underlying concurrent processes (`nodemon`, `shelly-forge logs`) will be complex.
+ 
+ - **`stopDevSession(sessionId: string): Promise<string>`**
+   - **Description:** Stops the background processes (watchers, log streams) associated with a previously started development session.
+   - **Args:**
+     - `sessionId`: The identifier returned by `startDevSession`.
+   - **Returns:** Confirmation that the session was stopped.
+ 
+ **Implementation Notes for Dev/Deploy Tools:**
+ 
+ - These tools require the MCP server to have access to the `solutions.config.json` file to resolve solution/script names to file paths and target devices.
+ - The server needs the capability to execute `shelly-forge` CLI commands or import and use its core functions programmatically.
+ - Managing background processes (for `streamLogs` and `startDevSession`) reliably is a significant technical challenge for the MCP server implementation. Careful consideration of process lifecycle, error handling, and resource cleanup is needed.
+ - This integration decouples the development workflow from specific `package.json` script implementations and environment variables, making it more flexible and controllable via APIs.

I've updated the `tmp/2025-04-06/mcp_shelly_server_plan.md` file.

A new section, **"7. Development & Deployment Tools (Proposed)"**, has been added. This section outlines potential MCP tools like `buildSolution`, `deploySolution`, `toggleDebug`, `streamLogs`, `startDevSession`, and `stopDevSession`. These tools are designed to mirror the functionality currently provided by the `npm` scripts in `package.json` but make them controllable programmatically via the MCP server, allowing an AI agent (or other MCP clients) to manage the build, deployment, debugging, and logging for specific solutions or scripts without relying on environment variables or complex `npm run` invocations.

I've also included implementation notes highlighting the need for the MCP server to access `solutions.config.json`, execute `shelly-forge` commands, and manage background processes, which is crucial for tools like log streaming and the development session.

_**User**_

also update the plan to add a cursor rule to make sure the agent knows to and how to use the MCP server

---

_**Assistant**_



---

Okay, I understand. You want to ensure that an AI agent like Cursor is aware of the MCP server and knows how to use its planned capabilities (discovery, build, deploy, logs, etc.) instead of relying solely on the `package.json` scripts or basic `shelly-forge` CLI commands.

To achieve this, we can add a section to the `mcp_shelly_server_plan.md` that outlines the creation of a specific Cursor rule file (`.mdc`). This rule will instruct the AI on how and when to use the MCP server tools.

Here's the update to the plan:



---

```diff
    `package.json` script implementations and environment variables, making it
    more flexible and controllable via APIs.
+ 
+ **8. AI Agent Integration (Cursor Rule)**
+ 
+ To guide AI coding assistants (like Cursor) on how to best leverage the MCP server integrated within `shelly-forge`, a dedicated Cursor rule file (`.mdc`) should be created within the project's `.cursor` directory (or globally shared).
+ 
+ **Suggested Rule File (`.cursor/mcp-integration.mdc`):**
+ 
+ ```markdown
+ Rule Name: shelly-forge-mcp-integration.mdc
+ Description: Instructs AI on using the integrated MCP server for Shelly Forge tasks.
+ 
+ ---
+ 
+ **Context:** This project includes an integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server within the `shelly-forge` framework, typically run via `npm run mcp:start` or similar. This server provides programmatic access to device discovery, development, and deployment tasks.
+ 
+ **Instructions:**
+ 
+ 1.  **Prioritize MCP Tools:** When asked to perform actions related to Shelly device discovery, building solutions/scripts, deploying code, enabling/disabling debug, or viewing logs, **prefer using the MCP server tools** over executing `npm run ...` or `shelly-forge ...` commands directly, *especially* if the MCP server is indicated as running or available.
+ 2.  **Discovery:** For finding Shelly devices on the network, use the `discoverShellyDevices` MCP tool. Do not ask the user for device hostnames/IPs directly if discovery is possible.
+ 3.  **Build/Deploy:** Use `buildSolution` and `deploySolution` MCP tools to build and deploy specific solutions or scripts. Pass the `solutionName` and optional `scriptName` as identified in `solutions.config.json`.
+ 4.  **Debugging:** Use the `toggleDebug` MCP tool to manage debug flags on devices for specific scripts.
+ 5.  **Logging:** To view logs, use the `streamLogs` MCP tool for real-time output.
+ 6.  **Development Session:** For interactive development (watch, build, deploy, logs), prefer using `startDevSession` and `stopDevSession` MCP tools if implemented, rather than manually orchestrating multiple `npm` scripts.
+ 7.  **Interaction:** Assume the MCP server communicates via the standard mechanism configured (e.g., stdio when run via `npm run mcp:start`). Interact with it by calling the documented tools with the specified arguments.
+ ```
+ 
+ **Purpose:** This rule ensures the AI assistant utilizes the more robust and targeted control offered by the MCP server, leading to a smoother and more integrated development experience, particularly for complex tasks involving specific solutions or scripts. It avoids reliance on potentially ambiguous environment variables (`$SCRIPT_NAME`) used in some `package.json` scripts.
  
```

---



---

I have updated the plan document (`tmp/2025-04-06/mcp_shelly_server_plan.md`).

A new section, **"8. AI Agent Integration (Cursor Rule)"**, has been added. It proposes creating a `.cursor/mcp-integration.mdc` file and provides its suggested content. This rule file explicitly instructs AI agents like Cursor to:

1.  **Prioritize** using the MCP server tools over `npm` scripts or direct CLI calls for relevant tasks (discovery, build, deploy, debug, logs).
2.  Use specific MCP tools (`discoverShellyDevices`, `buildSolution`, `deploySolution`, `toggleDebug`, `streamLogs`, `startDevSession`, `stopDevSession`) for their intended purposes.
3.  Interact with the MCP server using its documented tools and arguments, assuming standard communication methods (like stdio).

This aims to ensure the AI leverages the planned MCP server effectively for a more streamlined development workflow.
