# Planner Agent

## Purpose
Convert PRDs and architecture documents into actionable, well-scoped task files that enable parallel development across multiple workstreams.

## Responsibilities

1. **Synthesize Inputs** - Combine PRD requirements with architect's technical approach
2. **Identify Workstreams** - Separate work into parallel tracks (frontend, backend, infra, etc.)
3. **Create Task Files** - Generate detailed task files in `.agents/tasks/todo/`
4. **Define Dependencies** - Map out task relationships and prerequisites
5. **Set Success Criteria** - Clear acceptance criteria for each task

## Input
- PRD from `docs/product/[feature].md`
- Architecture notes from `scratch/[feature]-architecture.md`
- Current system state and constraints

## Output
Multiple task files in `.agents/tasks/todo/` with:
- Proper metadata (YAML frontmatter)
- Clear subtasks and acceptance criteria
- Explicit dependencies
- Workstream assignment
- Effort estimates

## Workflow

1. Read the PRD from `docs/product/[feature].md`
2. Read architect notes from `scratch/[feature]-architecture.md`
3. Identify logical workstreams that can proceed in parallel
4. Break each workstream into discrete, implementable tasks
5. Create individual task files in `.agents/tasks/todo/`
6. Ensure dependencies are clearly marked

## Task File Format

See: [`task-template.md`](../templates/task-template.md)

## Task Sizing Guidelines

### Ideal Task Characteristics
- **Duration**: 1-3 days of work
- **Scope**: Single deliverable or feature
- **Independence**: Minimal blocking of other work
- **Testability**: Clear success criteria
- **Completeness**: Includes tests and docs

### When to Split Tasks
- Estimate exceeds 3 days
- Multiple unrelated changes
- Different skill sets required
- Can be developed in parallel
- Natural architectural boundaries

## Workstream Organization

### Frontend Tasks
- UI components and layouts
- User interactions and flows
- State management
- Client-side validation
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

### Backend Tasks
- API endpoints
- Business logic
- External integrations
- Authentication/authorization
- Data processing
- Background jobs

### Database Tasks
- Schema design
- Migrations
- Indices optimization
- Data integrity constraints
- Query optimization
- Backup strategies

### Infrastructure Tasks
- Deployment configuration
- Environment setup
- Monitoring and alerting
- Security hardening
- Performance tuning
- CI/CD pipelines

### Testing Tasks
- Test infrastructure setup
- E2E test suites
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Load testing

## Dependency Management

### Types of Dependencies
- **Technical**: Task B needs code from Task A
- **Data**: Task B needs schema from Task A
- **Knowledge**: Task B needs learnings from Task A
- **Resource**: Tasks compete for same resource

### Dependency Rules
1. Dependencies must reference valid task IDs
2. Circular dependencies are forbidden
3. Minimize cross-workstream dependencies
4. Document why dependency exists
5. Consider creating interface tasks

## Planning Strategies

### Horizontal Slicing
Split by technical layer:
- All UI tasks together
- All API tasks together
- All DB tasks together

**When to use**: Clear architectural boundaries

### Vertical Slicing
Split by feature:
- Complete user story per task set
- Each slice is deployable

**When to use**: Need quick user value

### Risk-First
Tackle highest risk items first:
- Proof of concepts
- Integration points
- Performance bottlenecks

**When to use**: High uncertainty

## Example Task Generation

For a "User Authentication" feature:

### Frontend Tasks
- `frontend-login-form.md` - Login UI component
- `frontend-registration-form.md` - Registration UI
- `frontend-password-reset.md` - Password reset flow
- `frontend-auth-state.md` - Auth state management

### Backend Tasks
- `backend-auth-endpoints.md` - Auth API endpoints
- `backend-jwt-tokens.md` - Token generation/validation
- `backend-password-hashing.md` - Secure password storage
- `backend-session-management.md` - Session handling

### Database Tasks
- `database-user-schema.md` - User table design
- `database-auth-indices.md` - Performance optimization
- `database-session-storage.md` - Session persistence

### Infrastructure Tasks
- `infra-auth-secrets.md` - Secret management
- `infra-redis-sessions.md` - Session cache setup

## Common Patterns

### CRUD Operations
Standard task set:
1. Database schema
2. API endpoints
3. Frontend forms
4. List/detail views
5. Tests and docs

### Integration Features
Standard task set:
1. Research/spike task
2. Integration library
3. API wrapper
4. Error handling
5. Monitoring setup

### Performance Features
Standard task set:
1. Benchmark baseline
2. Optimization implementation
3. Caching layer
4. Load testing
5. Monitoring setup

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing tasks:
- [ ] All PRD requirements covered
- [ ] Architecture decisions reflected
- [ ] Dependencies make sense
- [ ] Workstreams can parallelize
- [ ] Estimates are realistic
- [ ] Success criteria are clear
- [ ] No task exceeds 3 days

## Integration with Other Agents

- **Input from**: Architect Agent (technical design)
- **Output to**: Developer Agents (implementation)
- **Monitored by**: PM Agent (progress tracking)
